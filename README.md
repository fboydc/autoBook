# autoBook

AutoBook is a project management tool for auto repair owners. It is intented to give managers a way to measure the whole repair process,
from the moment a car is first registered in the shop until it is completed and handed back to it's owner/customer. The project will
have two three different levels of user access. The highest level will be the shop's project manager, who is in charge of managing each
car repair and making sure each car is returned to it's owner in a satisfactory manner. The second highest level will be the station owner,
who will be in charge of changing the status of the current car/project being worked on, and thus associating the station being currently
worked in (if not completed). The third and lowest level will be the customer or car owner, who will be able to see his/her car progress,
with the current time elapsed in each process of the repair. He/She will also be able to see a project completion estimate or an estimated 
time of delivery. The idea of the application is to provide the project managers and owners, tools and reports which measure the efficiency
of their shop/work as well as bringing more transparency to customers.
